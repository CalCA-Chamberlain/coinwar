        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1> This agreement is between you and the gigantic business entity called
        &quot;coinwar.app&quot; (hereafter referred to as The Corporation). By using this
        service, you agree to the following: <br /><br />
        <h2>Where We're Getting Your Data</h2> We collect data on you from:&#160; the GPS tracking
        system in
        your car, the Tile you've got in your wallet, website cookies, old hard drives you thought
        you'd wiped, pay per click advertising, your IP address, purchased customer lists, your email,
        tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, friend lists, social engineering, keystroke analysis,
        traffic
        light cameras, drone footage, smart speakers, in-home security systems, saved Alexa voice
        data, ATM cameras, phone app tracking, cell phone biometric sensor data, bluetooth sensor
        tags, cell tower triangulation, government databases, credit card company data breaches, the
        darknet, and about a million other sources. <br /><br />
        <h2> Things We'll Do With Your Data</h2> Your data will be used, folded, cut, spindled,
        mutilated,
        sliced, diced, filigreed, pureed, and its DNA extracted and assimilated. Your data
        distinctiveness will be added to that of others (not necessarily human) then irradiated,
        exposed to lightning, loaded into an Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, and finally
        transmogrified into Frankendata&reg;.&#160;<br /><br />
        <h2>Unfettered Third-Party Use of Your Data</h2> Your data will be sold, given freely to, or
        stolen
        by third parties. Third-parties may include, but are not limited to, coupon companies, online
        poker websites, Russian bride catalogues, political entities you don't agree with, drug
        companies, lingerie stores, third-tier social media companies, stock market scammers, that ex
        you&rsquo;re trying to avoid, fake news agencies, and of course Nigerian princes. <br /><br />
        Your data may be used to create fake ID's, engage in voter fraud, create deepfakes, social media
        sock puppets, straw men, create false Amazon reviews, sell your friends things they don't
        need, and because of all this your face could very well end up on the back of a milk
        carton.&#160;<br /><br />
        <h2>Lack of Data Security</h2> Your data will not be held securely.&#160;<br /><br />
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence Systems / New Overlords</h2> You agree that your information will be
        used by various artificial entities for purposes both unknown and unknowable. Further, you
        understand and agree that The Corporation cannot know or understand how the evolving race of
        artificial intelligence beings will use your personal data because the technology upon which
        their society was founded has changed dramatically since the time you began reading this
        sentence.<br /><br />
        <h2>Letting Us Off the Hook</h2> You agree to accept all liability now and for all time
        regarding
        the use of your data in any form by The Corporation or any third-parties which may obtain your
        data through any means. You agree to hold The Corporation harmless under any and all
        circumstances and in any legal venue globally.&#160;<br /><br />
        <h2>Byzantine Information Removal Policy</h2> If you would like to have your personal
        information
        removed from our database simply hand deliver a letter written in fancy cursive writing to our
        constantly moving RV somewhere in North America. Include your name, social security number,
        address,
        date of birth, ATM PIN, photographs of three forms of government ID, the name of your
        favorite teacher, the model name of your first car, and your favorite concert. If you
        successfully find us, please allow 4-6 weeks for processing.
